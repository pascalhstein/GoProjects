# VARGO

Vargo is a lightweight network scanner built with **Go**. 

## Purpose
This is a private project designed to explore and master core Go concepts. The main focus lies on:
* **Concurrency:** Implementing efficient goroutines for scanning.
* **Data Structures:** Deep dive into slices and maps.
* **Cache Handling:** Managing state and performance.
* **CLI Interfaces:** Using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for robust flag and command handling.
